## How to Play

### Goal
Maximize your colour score across 6 guesses while avoiding the answer.

### Scoring
- 🟩 Green tile (correct letter, correct position) = **2 points**
- 🟨 Yellow tile (correct letter, wrong position) = **1 point**
- ⬛ Grey tile = **0 points**

### The Twist
**If you guess the exact answer, you lose immediately!** The answer is a trap to avoid.

### Rules
1. You have exactly 6 guesses
2. Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word
3. You cannot repeat the same word
4. Each (letter, position) pair scores only once:
   - If you get a green O in position 3, future green O's in position 3 score 0
   - If you get a yellow B in position 1, future yellow B's in position 1 score 0
   - But yellow B in position 4 would score (different position)

### Strategy Tips
- Early guesses: Fish for letters (find yellows)
- Middle guesses: Convert yellows to greens
- Late guesses: Maximize new pairs without completing the answer
- Never complete the answer!

### Controls
- **Type** on your keyboard (or use on-screen keyboard)
- **Enter** to submit a guess
- **Backspace** to delete a letter

## Your Score

After 6 guesses (or hitting the answer), you'll see:
- Your total colour score
- PAR (theoretical maximum)
- Your percent of PAR

50-70% is good, 80%+ is excellent!
